SPEAKER
I'm guessing they pay you out on it.

SPEAKER
Yes, yeah. So but we wouldn't be able to.

SPEAKER
Can you? Can you say that again?

SPEAKER 
Because I need I wouldn't be able to touch your car.

SPEAKER 
You wouldn't be able to touch my car? Like not at all? Not even if I said I pay out of pocket for the whole thing to get repaired?

SPEAKER 
or so if I was to repair that I wouldn't have to replace. And then you mentioned that they had done more damage to the car. Yeah, which was the bad and then the electronics. Yeah. So when they messed up the when they replaced the fog lights. All of the electrical warning systems inside the car were going haywire. Yeah. So so that's where it goes in. So I would be chasing a repair. So let's say that I started repairing a replacement bumper and replace your fog lights. I recreated those things. And then I'll take it to BMW because this is what happens with every single one of our BMW cars. I go to grab the car and take it a BMW for recalibration. So if there's anything wrong with any of the wires, especially since there's wires hanging right now, and what happens is that if it's rains, it creates corrosion. It gets corroded in there, and then it transfers all the way around the wires. It could be just one this side but it could transfer all the way across. across other things, so I just delivered a car that is on one side from an estimate that I wrote a customer pay estimate that I wrote before $1,000 turned out to be

SPEAKER 
I mean, after making the bad mistake, I made the final decider shop I really do need to see if I can get an estimate.


SPEAKER 
You won't be able to provide Could you could you look at my car and actually draft up an estimate of some kind. So how would I get an accurate estimate? Would I need to take it into BMW and have them do it? So BMW

SPEAKER 
can look at it? And I mean, even even BMW won't be able to tell you exactly what it like they'll be able to get the vehicle in and then just do a diag on the on the electronics before anybody touches anything else. And then once they run that DAC, they they'll be able to tell us if there's any other wires that are that have been corroded because the moment that it gets corroded, it needs to be written the wire needs to be replaced. Like if you're not going to it's not going to be calibrated correctly. Okay. And then if they replace the headlight so this headlights have modules on the back so if they replace a headlight, I don't know if they're replaced the modules or the transfer the modules. So that also needs to be recalibrated. I don't know if they did that whenever you took it over there to them. I think this one may not have Yeah, this one doesn't have the market this one is halogen. So the moment that you repair and then the and then they left the reflector open and that should have been replaced. That's the first thing that they didn't do. They can't you cannot reuse it again, and it's still dead.

SPEAKER 
And then you said that's not flushed? They're reflected?

SPEAKER 
Yeah. So in order in order for me for us to touch a vehicle, it needs to be repaired. By the shop, like correctly the way that they did it before we begin to start apparently, like, like, I don't know how much more damage if you want to go to BMW and then run a diag because I can charge you just for for just a cosmetic. But the problem is that if I if I started working on your car and something is not working properly, I'm the last one to touch your car. A safety item or something electronic is not working properly, or BMW three series they tend to like any electronic because everything's auto trying if you run into a bump, something doesn't touch correctly. And any of those electronics, it shuts off and it blocks everything out of the car and it goes like crazy on the dash d are not able to drive anymore and locks on your

SPEAKER 
head on that. So in order for me to figure out everything that is wrong with my car and to get an actual quote, like what it would be to repair it. What do you recommend that I do? Got a BMW, BMW Yeah. And tell them why

SPEAKER 
Tell them, hey, I had this car repaired before I had my dash and electronics. Do all this. I want to see what it would cost to run a diagnostic is about 200 bucks. Okay, and they run the Diag and they tell you exactly what some plugs are what needs to be replaced or what notes gave you a condition or report which is what we get to hear from them. And then that conditioner report if you have that conditioner report, I'll be able to add any additional things on the car, which is I'm going to replace the bumper like I wouldn't be able to repair that. So I'll replace replace the bumper. And then

SPEAKER 
in that first post that you gave me to replace the bumper would that be the same price or? Yeah. When I also talk to you guys on the phone, someone said that the prices have gone up since last time,

SPEAKER 
labor, labor. So the price on the parts that didn't change. But the price on the labor Yes, it has changed.

SPEAKER 
I would it be possible for Okay, so then if I'm understanding correctly, I go to BMW and have them do a full electronical diagnosis. And then I get the report from them then I can bring it back to you. And what that does for you guys for caliber collisions with that doesn't just make sure that you're not held liable for any of the crazy ass crazy acid.

SPEAKER 
Because the moment I started working on it without a diag I'm liable for yourself.

SPEAKER 
I don't I don't I I've got no problems going.

SPEAKER 
Because what could happen is that I repair this in the front and I'd say it's to the to that and then all of a sudden Alright, the last thing I need to do to calibrate everything on the front is taking a BMW. So BMW looks at it and they run a DAC. And I say, Oh, this car has $4,000 worth of electric issues that I need to repair. I'm just talking like this is this could be like, almost worst case scenario, but since it just happened to me and the last card that I live on Friday, so sorry. I know that I know that I could keep going. Okay, so

SPEAKER 
then because I want to make sure because this is a nightmare. That's not as hard. Yeah. So I should take it to BMW. Get the Diag, out of the electrical diagnosis, bring that paperwork back to you. And because the parts that need to be replaced are all the same as the original estimate that you wrote back for me, whatever ago. Would it be possible to so I have a sorry, just so I have an under okay. And then if I did that, if I brought it back for you to repair it, then you would you already have this diagnosis from BMW. I brought the car back you repaired all the body damage. When you're done with the body damage? Do you typically take it back to BMW and have them do the recalibration before you give it back to customers like me? So in this whole process, if I get it done the right way BMW will touch my car twice. And that's something is that only something that's certified BMW people do is that is that why Cadillac livings as a certified BMW repair place? Yes. Because when you're done with the work, you have BMW check it out before you give it back. Yeah.

SPEAKER 
They basically put it in their diet computer. They make sure that everything is running properly.

SPEAKER 
And that's what makes you guys certified versus non certified impairments. Then, would it be possible for you to send me like the old the old coach is updated with the new labor?

SPEAKER 
Yeah, I can take a look at it and get it

SPEAKER 
because I Yeah. Yeah. Then then that's all I would ask is if you could I still have them. I can send them to you if you need them.

SPEAKER 
Yeah, can you send it to me?

SPEAKER 
I'll give you copies of them and then I can resend them to you all. I'll email them.

SPEAKER 
Actually, if I take a picture of it that way I can.

SPEAKER 
I made a copy for you. Here, you can have them real Yeah. I just printed them up from the email that you sent me last time. So what I'm gonna do then is wait for you to send me this stuff. Dated labor pass. I'm gonna go to B and I'll make an appointment with them today. But as far as the other stuff, where do you recommend I go for the

SPEAKER 
any interior detail you can Google any interior mobile. Tell me about that. No, probably not. They I think they use a third party companies too. But you we use tours detailing. Tory Boris. detail out of detailing is Downing Street right here on Manchac road. Yeah,

SPEAKER 
I can just look that up on my phone. Yeah. And the other thing is, how long is the pair like when I originally got this? How long do you think it would take to actually if I brought my car in here?

SPEAKER 
I won't know until I actually have a car inside the shop. What is it? We're talking about like two three weeks right now. Just if I was to start working on it. Yeah.

SPEAKER 
Three weeks worst case scenario three weeks or worst case scenario month. So 84 days for something like this, which is three months? Is that? That's a lot.

SPEAKER
Yeah, I would have had your car out. If if that would have been the case and we would have gone through insurance and everything. Yeah, my goal is to get it out as soon as possible. I feel would have been just the front bumper. I would have been like two weeks. Two weeks, three weeks the most. Yeah, that's, that's this is why like BMWs are very specific and you need to work with somebody that knows how to how they work.

SPEAKER 
I thought that I was going to someone who knew how it worked. Yeah, I didn't. So you'll get back to Where's where's BMW? Located?

SPEAKER 
Right here on South Austin. 35.

SPEAKER 
Awesome. How far away is that? Three miles. Four miles. Oh, okay. Well, then.

SPEAKER 
Yeah, talk to Charles. And then just let them know like, hey, I want to see if you know, I'm having issues with my electronics. On the front. I want to see how much you charge for a diag and see what's wrong with it. Okay,

SPEAKER 
thank you so much. Yeah, no problem.

SPEAKER 
Okay, my recap of that my understanding is. Let's just go to BMW because caliber collision who is a certified BMW repair facility will not touch my car after it was repaired by blackforest workshop without me first going and getting an electronical diagnose some kind of electronical Diag. Get my electronics diagnosed directly from BMW. And it seems like one of the reasons Calibur collisions is a certified BMW repair facility is because after they do the work on BMWs any repair work that calibre does, they take it to BMW itself to make sure everything is properly calibrated, because BMW has all these complications and sensors before caliber collisions gives the car back to the customer. So I should have had my car down here, but I didn't look okay. I'm gonna go to BMW. Now.
